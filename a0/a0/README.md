# TCP Client and Server

See the assignment specification on ELMS.

We highly recommend you look at and utilize the [optparser](https://gitlab.cs.umd.edu/cmsc417-s24/all/materials/-/tree/main/a0) and the [hash](https://gitlab.cs.umd.edu/cmsc417-s24/all/materials/-/tree/main/hash) code for this assignment. You need not understand everything in the hash code, but getting the gist would be helpful.

We also highly recommend you read through the first few chapters of the book *TCP/IP Sockets in C*. It will be a helpful introduction to socket programming. You can access the 1st edition eBook through [UMD Libraries](https://umaryland.on.worldcat.org/oclc/647697094) via EBSCOHost.
